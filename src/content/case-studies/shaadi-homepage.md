metaDescription: "A modern, emotionally-driven homepage redesign for an Indian matchmaking platform to reduce friction, build trust, and improve engagement."
overview:
  sections:
    - title: "Brief"
      content: "Shaadi.com has been a pioneer in online matchmaking in India, but user expectations and digital behavior have evolved. The existing homepage felt cluttered, transactional, and out of sync with how modern Indian users want to experience matchmaking."
    - title: "Problem"
      content: "Users reported feeling overwhelmed by the layout, generic CTAs, and scattered messaging. Many left the homepage without exploring how the platform could actually help them find a partner."

    role:
      - "UX Designer"
      - "UX Engineer"
    team:
      - "Product Owner"

    data:
      title: "Discover"
      content: "Research revealed four core issues: too many choices and weak hierarchy on the hero, a lack of emotional connection in visuals and copy, friction in the initial form entry, and inconsistent storytelling as users scrolled down the page."
  - type: "text"
    data:
      title: "Define"
      content: "The insights were reframed into key questions: How might we reduce friction in the first interaction? How might we present credibility without overwhelming users? How might we make matchmaking feel more personal, warm, and inviting?"
  - type: "text"
    data:
      title: "Goals"
      content: "Streamline the journey from visitor to sign-up, build trust quickly using social proof and emotional design, and deliver a modern, clean interface with intuitive microcopy optimised for Indian users on both desktop and mobile."
  - type: "left-text-image"
    data:
      title: "Wireframes: Clarity and Hierarchy"
      content: "Low-fidelity wireframes focused on simplifying the hero, clarifying the primary action, and introducing a stronger vertical rhythm. Sections for value proposition, social proof, and how-it-works were clearly separated to guide users step by step."

    data:
      title: "Design: Emotion + Trust"
